# Acknowledgments

I was inspired by [h2y's solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/entertainment-web-app-nextjs-and-tailwindcss-and-tmdb-api-rJmJYIpX5) for this challenge by implementing TMDB API into the application and adding more features such as viewing details about a specific Movie or Show.
